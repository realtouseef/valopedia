## API

create a `.env` file and add `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENTS="https://valorant-api.com/v1/agents"`

## To run dev

```bash
yarn dev
```

## TODOs

- [x] SEO
- [ ] Cache the agent page
- [ ] Moving main page inside a card that displays "Agents" -- when clicked on it, it goes to another page that shows every agent
- [ ] Adding more content -- basically (almost) everything that is given by the API
- [ ] Move to TypeScript in future
