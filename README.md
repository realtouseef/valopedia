## Completed TODOs

- [x] SEO
- [x] Move to TypeScript
- [x] Fix the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'displayIcon')` in production in `agent/[agent].jsx`
- [x] Fix the Weapon page layout
- [x] Move to styled-components
- [x] Create a Card component which takes childrens -- Agents, weapons, seasons, etc are shown on the homepage
- [x] Cache the pages (static pages don't need to be cached)
- [x] dynamically creating pages -- `[...slug].jsx` on the pages folder
- [x] Moving main page inside a card that displays "Agents" -- when clicked on it, it goes to another page that shows every agent
- [x] Add maps
- [x] `maps/ee613ee9-28b7-4beb-9666-08db13bb2244` error is `The Range` and doesn't have a `displayIcon` â€” possible fix is to use ternary operator
- [x] **FIX THE DEPLOYMENT ERROR BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE.**

- [x] Add Weapon buddies (https://valorant-api.com/v1/buddies) -- not adding buddies by uuid because same content.
- [x] `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'default')` is the `Sova` with `isPlayableCharacter = false` id: `/agent/ded3520f-4264-bfed-162d-b080e2abccf9` â€” possible fix is to use ternary operator
