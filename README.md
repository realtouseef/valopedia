- [ ] Adding more content -- basically (almost) everything that is given by the API
- [ ] Move to TypeScript in future

## Completed TODOs

- [x] SEO
- [x] Fix the Weapon page layout
- [x] Move to styled-components
- [x] Create a Card component which takes childrens -- Agents, weapons, seasons, etc are shown on the homepage
- [x] Cache the pages (static pages don't need to be cached)
- [x] dynamically creating pages -- `[...slug].jsx` on the pages folder
- [x] Moving main page inside a card that displays "Agents" -- when clicked on it, it goes to another page that shows every agent
